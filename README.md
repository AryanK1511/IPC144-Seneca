# Seneca College IPC144 Workshops
This repository contains all the IPC144 (Introduction to programming using C) workshops that I have done as a student at Seneca College.

Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually wanna learn how to write software and a blatant violation of the [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
